## Repository etiquette

- File paths to be kept short and sensible, use Github relative file paths instead of local computer file paths. 
- Do not use capital letters, funky characters, symbols or spaces in file names
- Always pull before you push to avoid coding conflicts
- Commit messages 
  - To be kept short and informative
  - Each message should revolve around one change or fix
